## What is avoid linux?

avoid linux is `a Void Linux distribution`. This default [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org) install provides an incredibly minimalistic pre-configured desktop. All the configuration you would do anyway has already been done so you can jump straight into the Void!

<!-- ## Modular and modern

Faenrir (name not final) is a small student project to learn and have fun. It basically is a pre-riced Void Linux distro (x86_64 glibc) that tries to follow the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) and provide students with all they'll need.

## Free as in freedom

New to [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/philosophy.html)? Check out these great articles about [Microsoft](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-microsoft.en.html), [Apple](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-apple.html#content) and [Google](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/malware-google.html#content).

Faenrir ships only with Free Software and all build tools are publicly available.

## Aesthetic

The desktop system is carefully designed for usability, it's both a joy to look at and to use it!

## No bloat & ready to kick ass

Life's better without bloat, Faenrir has a strict no-bloat-policy. But that does not mean you'll have to do without anything. Faenrir is designed to give better defaults than many other distros and is ready for anything you'll need.

## A great teacher

GNU/Linux can be difficult for beginners, but many popular GNU/Linux distributions already make it as easy and simple as Windows.

Faenrir takes a bold approach, in some ways it will force you to learn how the system actually works. But don't be afraid! The [docs](https://docs.faenrir.com) are here to help & guide you through it all.

What's in it for you? You will learn things that many distros hide from it's users in fear that it might be 'too complicated', that knowledge will help you with any other GNU/Linux or UNIX-like operating system and greatly improve your every day computing for the rest of your life.
