## What is avoid linux?

Avoid Linux (A Void Linux distribution) is desktop-focused operating system based on `Void Linux`. It's purpose is to teach Linux and it also can be used as cool pre-configured distro. Somewhat inspired by [Archcraft](https://archcraft-os.github.io/).

## What's up with the name?

Do you want to frigg me off? No, of course the name is as joke and ironic. But it also seems to fit the common behaviour of some people, you could say they try to 'avoid linux'.

## Benefits of Avoid Linux

Avoid Linux is `ready-to-go` after the installation, but currently it is not really special in any way. Users are actually supposed to built up a good knowledge of Linux with this distro and are encouraged to use the official Void Linux distribution afterwards. That's where the actual hard work happens! Want to support this project? Support Void Linux!
